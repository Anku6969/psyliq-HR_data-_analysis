# HR ANALYSIS REPORT
The HR report,presents an in-depth data analysis using Excel and Power BI. The project involves filtering and visualizing employee data to reveal significant trends and insights. Excel was employed for tasks like filtering data based on age, creating pivot tables to summarize monthly income, applying conditional formatting, and identifying data inconsistencies. Power BI was used to establish relationships between datasets, create calculated columns, and visualize data trends, such as employee attrition rates over time. The report also delves into building a star schema for performance analysis, which improves query efficiency and scalability. Additionally, parameterized queries and a rolling 3-month average calculation were implemented to enhance dynamic data interaction.
